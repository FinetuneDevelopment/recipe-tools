Adjust quantities accordingly if you want a stronger Grand Marnier flavor or less of a coffee flavor\n- If you're uncomfortable with raw eggs, you can buy pasteurized eggs or pasteurize them yourself by immersing the eggs in a 57.2C (135F) water bath for 75 minutes using a sous-vide (which is what we did).\n- Note that the amount of mixture this produces may be too much for your ice cream machine.

We've tried it on beef, duck, even carbonara! Might be a good idea to make more than is needed for this dish and keep it around.\n- If you have sauce leftovers, it keeps well in the fridge for days in an airtight container. It may darken a bit due to the avocado but it still tastes good.",

If not low-carbing, demarara or other sugar can be substituted.\n- Bell peppers are bad for absorbing pesticides, so we always use organic because the skin is eaten.\n- The type of red wine is not critical, honestly. We use small (187ml) “individual” bottles of fairly cheap red wine.",
